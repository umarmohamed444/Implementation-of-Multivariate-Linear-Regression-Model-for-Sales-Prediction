# Implementation-of-Multivariate-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Sales-Prediction

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the multivariate linear regression model for sales prediction.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
~~~
1.Import the required libraries.
2.Read the csv file using pandas.
3.Declare X and Y variable with respect to the dataset.
4.Predict the values.
5.Using Mean Square Error find the required line that fits the data.
6.Print the Mean Square Error and R square error.
7.End the program. 
~~~
